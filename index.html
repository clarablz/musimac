      <h3>The concept</h3>
      <p>Musimac box is an interactive music box that allows you to use machine learning to see how a pre-trained AI
        would continue a song.
        You can either test the pre-trained AI with our preloaded songs, or you can upload your own MIDI file to test
        it.
        Please note that not every MIDI file fits well. MusicRNN only works with monophonic music, so it will convert
        your polyphonic song into a monophonic melody. That’s why you sometimes won’t recognize your music.
      </p>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>Click on any song of the library to load it, then play “start” to listen to the original beginning of the song.
        When finished, click “continue” and let the magic begin! You will hear how the AI would continue the song. If
        not satisfied, you can click again on “continue” to have a different version (some will be better than others).
      </p>

      <h3>Our motivation behind this project</h3>
      <p>Since we are both pianists, the idea to create music with a pre-trained AI got us intrigued and interested. We
        thought that this website would be a nice feature that could really inspire musicians seeking for new musical
        experience. </p>

      <h3>Testing the limits of this AI</h3>
      <p>While coding the website and testing the pre-trained AI offered by MusicRNN to continue a given note sequence,
        we noticed that some results sounded weird or nothing like the original music, but others actually sounded
        great!
        Moreover, we uploaded different musical style to our library to test the limits of this pre-trained model.
        Perhaps the Fantaisie-Impromptu was to much…but it allowed us to really see the limit of this model.
        Thus, our project is limited by the pretrained AI that we can question, but it made us want to learn how this AI
        can be trained, and why not training our own!
      </p>
